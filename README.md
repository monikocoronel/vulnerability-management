- Get IP address from your VM by typing “ifconfig"

Ping the VM’s IP address from your local computer to make sure you can reach it.  You’ll see it’s timed out, so you’ll need to disable the firewall on the virtual machine.

- Go to wf.msc and open firewall>Windows Defender firewall properties> turn off the firewall state for the “Domain Profile”, “ Private profile”, and “ Public profile”. The ping will then go through on the local computer. 

<h2>Create new scan in Nessus (with no credentials)</h2>

Create a new scan and put the VM’s IP address inside the target to do a basic network port scan. Save and then run.

You can see the results of the initial scan: 1 high, 5 medium, and 37 info
